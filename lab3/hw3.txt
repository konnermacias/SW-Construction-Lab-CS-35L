Q1. "case_long_iso_time_style" was not necessary, since control flow
never passed through it. In fact, it was repeated twice.

Q2. The patch would have issues in other countries where users don't
understand English-format dates because the patch removes the users 
locale setting. So it wont care about what the user was used to before.

Q3. After doing:
$ vim randline.py

and pasting in the contents into the file, I ran

$ python randline.py /dev/null

Which gave me this error:
IndexError: list index out of range

This indexError occured because inside of the random.choice function, 
it will raise an IndexError if the seq is empty. So for handling empty
files, this will always be the case since we didn't specify that the
number of lines is 0

Q4. I did:
$ python3 randline.py
which gave me the error:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is invalid syntax for python3 because it no longer allows for
comma syntax, it is now deprecated. (fewf,ewfqewfq) is an example of
whats called a tuple and python3 does not have tuple automatic
unpacking.
