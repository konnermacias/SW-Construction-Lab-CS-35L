Homework
==============================
1. Even if the other teams really had been observing all the bytes
going across the network, the network would still be secure since 
the private key needed to decrypt the data is never sent across the
network.

(1) Assuming the other team kept track of our keystrokes, my answer
would change since now when we enter our password when doing ssh, the
other team will learn the private key password needed to decrypt the 
data. 

(2) If the other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB
then my answer would change. With this control, the other team could
gain access to the .ssh folder which contain the private key needed
to decrypt the data. The network is no longer secure.
==============================
2. The command gpg --verify doesn't really verify that you personally
created the tar file in question since it only checks the signature of
the file. If the data was intercepted, changed and signed by some 
person with a different public key, then the command gpg --verify will
reveal to the true intended receiver that the owner was this person
who intercepted the data. To fix this problem, we would need a trusted
third party to verify the origin/true creator of the file.
