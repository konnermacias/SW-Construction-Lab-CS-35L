Partner: Cavan Stewart
==============================
To start this assignment, after connecting to the BeagleBone, I did:

$ sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

Then I did:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

We will be using openssh to connect to the other hosts. Now my partner
and I had both openssh-server and openssh-client.

I personally had troubles connecting to internet, so I did:

$ sudo connmanctl
Then within that, I did:
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on

connect wifi_2cf7f1062d5e_47726174617461_managed_psk
==============================
I will be acting as the client. 

Now, I obtained the IP address of my partner's computer.
$ root@beaglebone:~# ssh konner@192.168.0.100

He had already created a user under the name of konner with password
'macias'. After confirming my desire to connect, I created a file:

$ vim file1.txt

In it, I put: "hackerman"

Next, I did: 
$ ssh keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.

$ ssh-copy-id -i konner@192.168.0.100

After being prompted for konner@192.168.0.100's password, it stated:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'konner@192.168.0.100'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

$ ssh konner@192.168.0.100
This did not prompt me for a password.

Next I ran as indicated in the TA slides:
$ ssh-add
$ ssh -X konner@192.168.0.100

After running $ xterm and $ firefox but obtained an error
opening the display.

Then I created a user for my partner
$ sudo useradd -d /home/caveman -m caveman
$ sudo passwd eggert
$ cd /home/caveman
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo  chown -R caveman .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Using $ ifconfig, I gave cavan my IP ddross for him to log into my 
server.

128.97.244.51

Then he created a file on my server to make it worked. I finished my
task behaving as the server.
